# EeveeSpotify

This tweak makes Spotify think you have a Premium subscription, granting free listening, just like Spotilife, and provides some additional features like custom lyrics.

## The History

In January 2024, Spotilife, the only tweak to get Spotify Premium, stopped working on new Spotify versions. I decompiled Spotilife, reverse-engineered Spotify, intercepted requests, etc., and created this tweak.

## Repositories

You can add an official EeveeSpotify repository to your signing app to always stay up to date.

## Restrictions

Please refrain from opening issues about the following features, as they are server-sided and will **NEVER** work:

- Very High audio quality
- Native playlist downloading (you can download podcast episodes though)
- Jam (hosting a Spotify Jam and joining it remotely requires Premium; only joining in-person works)
- AI DJ/Playlist
- Spotify Connect (When using Spotify Connect, the device will act as a remote control and stream directly to the connected device. This is a server-sided limitation and is beyond the control of EeveeSpotify, so it will behave as if you have a Free subscription while using this feature.)

It's possible to implement downloading locally, but it will never be included in EeveeSpotify (unless someone opens a pull request).
